====== Sanhedrin ======

===== Definition: =====

The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish rabbinic judicial council in ancient Israel. The word literally means "a sitting together" or "assembly."

  * The Sanhedrin had 70 members, which included Jewish leaders such as chief priests, elders, scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees..
  * Jesus was brought before the Sanhedrin before he was sent to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate. In New Testament times the Sanhedrin could bring charges against criminals but they had no power to put someone to death; only the Roman government had the right to do that.
  * Years later, the apostle Paul also had charges brought against him before the Sanhedrin.
  * Ways to translate this could include, "Jewish Legal Council" or "Jewish Leaders' Council" or "Jewish Supreme Assembly."
