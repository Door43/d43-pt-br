====== purify, purification ======

===== Definition: =====


To purify something is to cleanse it and remove anything that contaminates or pollutes it. Purification is the action or process of cleansing. 

◾ In the Old Testament, “purification” mainly refers to the cleansing from things that make an object or a person ritually unclean; there are many laws about how a person can be purified from such things as illness, contact with a dead body, contact with body fluids, or childbirth.


◾ The Old Testament also had laws telling people how to be purified from sin, usually by the sacrifice of an animal. This was only temporary and the sacrifices had to be repeated over and over again.


◾ In the New Testament, to be purified often refers to being cleansed from sin. The only way that people can be completely and permanently purified from sin is through repenting and receiving God 's forgiveness, through trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice.
