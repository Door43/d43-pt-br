====== righteous, just ======


===== Definition: =====

The word "righteous" means morally good and without fault. A righteous person does what is right, good, and proper. However, no one except God is completely righteous.

    * Righteous people obey God and live in a way that pleases him.
    * God judges people as righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them and cleanse them from their sins. 
    * Jesus lived a completely righteous life on earth. When people trust in him and follow him in obedience, God gives them Jesus' righteousness. 

"Righteous" is the opposite of "wicked."
