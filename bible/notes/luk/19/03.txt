====== Luke 19:3-4-F ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 3 He tried to see Jesus, but he was very short and there was a big crowd of people \add near Jesus\add*. So he was not able to see him. \v 4 So he ran further ahead \add along the road\add* that Jesus was walking on. He climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see Jesus. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 3 He wanted to see Jesus but he could not see him over the crowd. He was a very short man and there were many people around Jesus. \v 4 So he ran further down the road. He climbed a sycamore-fig tree so he could see Jesus when he came by. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 3 He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd, because he was small in height. \v 4 So he ran on ahead of the people and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was about to pass that way. </usfm>
