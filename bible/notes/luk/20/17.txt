===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to speak to the crowd.)
  * **But he looked at them**  - "But Jesus stared at them" or "But he looked straight at them." He did this to hold them accountable to understand what he was saying.
  * **What does this scripture mean**  - This rhetorical question can also be translated as "Then what was this scripture talking about?" or "You should be able to understand this scripture." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **The stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone**  - This metaphor is a prophecy about how people would reject the Messiah. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|metaphor]])
  * **The stone which the builders rejected**  - "The stone which the builders said was not good enough for building with." In those days people built the walls of houses and other buildings out of stones.
  * **the cornerstone**  - This was an important stone for making a building stable. It can be translated as "the chief stone" or "the most important stone."
  * **Everyone that falls on that stone**  - "Anyone who falls down onto that stone." This metaphor is a prophecy about what will happen to everyone who rejects the Messiah.
  * **will be broken to pieces**  - "will break up into pieces." This is a result of falling onto the stone.
  * **But on whomever it falls**  - "But whomever that stone falls on." This metaphor is a prophecy about the Messiah judging those who reject him.
