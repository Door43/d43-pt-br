===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **but you teach the truth about the way of God**  - This is part of what the spy was saying that they knew about Jesus.
  * **are not influenced by anyone**  - Possible meanings are 1) "you tell the truth even if important people do not like it" (UDB) or 2) "you do not favor one person over another."
  * **Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar**  - They hoped that Jesus would say either "yes" or "no." If he said "yes," then the Jewish people would be angry with him for telling them to pay taxes to a foreign government. If he said "no," then the religious leaders could tell the Romans that Jesus was teaching the people to break the Roman laws.
  * **Is it lawful**  - They were asking about God's law, not about Caesar's law. This can also be translated "Does our law permit us."
  * **Caesar**  - Because Caesar was the ruler of the Roman government, they could refer to the Roman government by Caesar's name. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy|metonymy]])
