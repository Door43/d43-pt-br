59 Depois de quase uma hora um outro homem insistiu dizendo: “Verdadeiramente este homem também estava com ele, porque é galileu.” 60 Mas Pedro disse: “Eu não sei do que você está falando, homem.” E imediatamente, enquanto ainda falava, o galo cantou.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **insisted and said**  - "said insistently" or "said loudly" (UDB)
  * **Truly this man** - "This man" refers to Peter. The speaker probably did not know Peter's name.
  * **he is a Galilean** - Matthew 26:73 says that the people could tell Peter was from Galilee from the way he talked.
  * **I do not know what you are saying**  - This idiom is used to say very strongly "What you said is not true at all" or "What you said is completely false." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:idiom]])
  * **while he was speaking** - "while Peter was speaking"
