42 Quando o dia surgiu, Jesus saiu para um lugar solitário para orar. Multidões de pessoas estavam procurando por ele e vieram até o lugar onde ele estava. Eles tentaram impedi-lo de ir embora. 43 Mas ele disse as eles, “Eu tenho que pregar as boas-novas sobre o reino de Deus para muitas outras cidades, pois é por esta razão que eu fui enviado.” 44 Então ele continuou pregando nas sinagogas em toda a província da Judeia.
