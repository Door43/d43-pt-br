<usfm> \v 28 All the people in the synagogue were filled with rage when they heard these things. \v 29 They got up and forced him out of the city, and led him to the edge of the hill on which their city was built, so that they might throw him over the cliff. \v 30 But he walked right through the midst of them and went on his way. </usfm>
===== Target ULB: =====
28 Todas as pessoas na sinagoga estavam furiosas quando ouviram ele. 29 Elas se levantaram e o forçaram para fora da cidade, e o levaram para a beirada da montanha na qual a cidade deles estava localizada. Desta forma, planejavam empurrar Jesus do penhasco.  30 Mas ele caminhou entre eles e seguiu o seu rumo.

  * <font inherit/inherit;;#B22222;;inherit>** bem pelo meio deles  ** - Isto poderia ser traduzido como: "através do meio deles" ou "entre as pessoas que estavam tentando matá-lo". A palavra "bem" aqui é parecida com a palavra "simplesmente". Ela indica que nada o impediu de passar pelas pessoas.</font>
