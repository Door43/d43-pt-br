  * **to proclaim freedom to the captives**  - This could be translated as "to tell people who are being held captive that they can go free" or "to set free the prisoners of war."
  * **recovery of sight to the blind**  - "to proclaim that the blind shall see" or "to give sight to the blind" or "to make the blind be able to see again"
  * **to set free those who are oppressed**  - "to set free those who are treated harshly"
  * **to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord**  - This could be translated as "to announce that this is the year that the Lord will show his kindness" or "to tell everyone that the Lord is ready to bless his people."
