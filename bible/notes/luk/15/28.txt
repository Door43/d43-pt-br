<usfm> \v 28 But the older brother was angry and did not want to go into the house. So his father came out and pleaded with him to come in. \v 29 But he replied to his father, 'Listen! For all these years I have worked for you as hard as a slave. I always obeyed everything you told me to do. But you never gave me even a young goat to eat so that I could give a feast with my friends. \v 30 But now that this son of yours has come back home, after wasting all your money on prostitutes, you have told your servants to kill the fattened calf for a celebration!' </usfm>

<usfm> \v 28 The elder son was angry, and would not go in, and his father came out, and begged him. \v 29 But the elder son answered and said to his father, 'Look, these many years I slaved for you, and I never broke a rule of yours, and yet you never gave me a young goat that I might have a feast with my friends, \v 30 but when your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed for him the fattened calf.' </usfm>
