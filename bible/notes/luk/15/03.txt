===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Jesus spoke this parable to them**  - "To them" refers to the religious leaders.
  * **Which one of you . . will not leave the ninety nine . . and go after . . until he finds it?**  - This is a rhetorical question. Jesus was reminding the people that if any of them lost one of their sheep, they would certainly go looking for it. This can be translated as a statement as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]]) Some languages have ways of showing that this is a hypothetical situation and not a story about a particular person who has lost a sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hypothetical|Hypothetical Situations]])
  * **Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep**  - Since the parable starts with "Which one of you", some languages would continue the parable in the second person "if you have a hundred sheep." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:123person|First, Second or Third Person]])
