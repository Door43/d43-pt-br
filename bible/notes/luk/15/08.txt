===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 8 Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she were to lose one coin, would not light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she has found it? \v 9 And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.' \v 10 Even so, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents." </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues speaking to the religious leaders.)
  * **What woman…would not light a lamp…and seek diligently until she has found it?**  - This is a rhetorical question. Jesus was reminding the people that if any of them lost a silver coin, they would certainly look for it diligently. This sentence can be translated as “You know that if a woman had ten silver coins and lost one, she would light a lamp, sweep the floor and search carefully until she has found it.” (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **what woman**  - This is a hypothetical situation and not a story about a real woman. Some languages have ways of showing this. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hypothetical|Hypothetical Situations]])
  * **Even so**  - "In the same way" or "Just as people would rejoice with the woman"
  * **over one sinner who repents**  - This can be translated as "when one sinner repents."
