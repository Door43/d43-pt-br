<usfm> \v 17 Finally he thought clearly about what he had done. He said to himself, 'All of my father's hired servants have plenty of food! They have more \f + \ft synecdoche \f* than they can eat, but here I am dying because I do not have anything to eat \f + \ft hyperbole \f*! \v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God \f + \ft metonymy, euphemism \f* and against you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*. \v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called \f + \ft Or:of \add you\add* calling me \f* your son. Just hire me to be like one of the other hired servants."' </usfm>

<usfm> \v 17 Finally he began to think clearly about how foolish he had been and he said to himself: 'All of my father's hired servants have more than enough food to eat but here I am dying because I do not have anything to eat! \v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God and against you. \v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; please just employ me to work for you as one of your hired servants."' </usfm>

<usfm> \v 17 But when the young son came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough food, and I am here, dying from hunger! \v 18 I will leave here and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. \v 19 I am no more worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired servants."' </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues his story.)
  * **came to himself**  - "came to his senses" or "understood his situation" or "began to think clearly"
  * **How many of my father's hired hands have more than enough food**  - This is part of an exclamation. It can be translated as "All my father's hired servants have more than enough food to eat" (UDB).
  * **dying from hunger**  - This is probably not an exaggeration. The young man may really have been starving.
  * **I have sinned against heaven**  - "I have sinned against God." Jewish people sometimes avoided saying the word "God" and used the word "heaven" instead.
  * **I am no more worthy to be called your son**  - "I am not worthy to be called your son." A son has the legal right to inherit part of his father's property.
  * **no more worthy**  - "no longer worthy" (UDB). It means that in the past he was worthy, but now he was not.
  * **make me as one of your hired servants**  - "hire me as an employee" or "hire me and I will become one of your servants"
