===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **A certain man**  - This is the beginning of a parable. Introduce it in a way that is natural in your language. Some languages might say "There was a man who."
  * **give me now**  - The son wanted his father to give it to him immediately. Languages that have a command form that means that they want it done immediately should use that form.
  * **the property I am due to inherit**  - "the part of your wealth that you planned to give to me when you die"
