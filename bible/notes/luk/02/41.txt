41 Os pais de Jesus iam todos os anos para o Festival da Páscoa, em Jerusalém. 42 Quando Jesus tinha doze anos, eles foram para o festival, como sempre faziam. 43 Após os dias de celebração terminarem eles começaram a voltar para casa. Mas o menino Jesus ficou em Jerusalém e seus pais não perceberam, 44 pois pensaram que estava no grupo que viajava com eles. Após um dia inteiro de jornada eles começaram a procurá-lo entre os familiares e amigos.
