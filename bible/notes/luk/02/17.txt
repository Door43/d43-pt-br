===== Target ULB: =====
17 Após verem isto, eles contaram as pessoas o que foi dito a eles sobre o bebê. 18 Todos que se encontraram com os pastores ficaram maravilhados com o que ouviam. Mas Maria não parava de pensar no que o anjo tinha dito a ela, e guardava isto em seu coração.  20 Os pastores retornaram ao campo, glorificando e louvando a Deus, pois tudo o que ouviram e viram era exatamente como o anjo lhes falou.
