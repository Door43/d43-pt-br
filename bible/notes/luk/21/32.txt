====== Luke 21:32-33-F ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 32 Keep this in mind: All the things that \add I have just now described\add* will happen before all the people who have observed the things that I have done have died. \v 33 \add You can be certain that these things\add* that I have told \add you\add* about will happen. That they will happen is more\add certain\add* than that the earth and sky will continue to exist."

\p </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 32 I am telling you the truth: this generation of people will not come to an end before all these things that I have just now described happen. \v 33 The sky and the earth will come to an end, but what I tell you will never come to an end.

\p </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 32 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away, until all of these things occur. \v 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. \p </usfm>
