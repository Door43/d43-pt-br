<usfm> \v 17 Then Jesus came down the mountain with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there, as well as a large number of the people from Judea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon. \v 18 They had come to listen to him and to be healed of their diseases.

===== Target ULB: =====
17 Então Jesus desceu do monte com eles e pararam em um lugar plano. Uma grande multidão de seus discípulos estavam lá, e também muitas pessoas vinham da Judeia e Jerusalém, e do litoral de Tiro e de Sidom.  18 Eles vinham para ouvir Jesus e para que ele os curassem de suas doenças. Pessoas que eram atormentadas por espíritos imundos também eram curadas. 19 Todos na multidão tentavam tocar Jesus, pois o poder de curar saia dele, e ele curava todos.

  * **and to be healed**  - This could be translated with the active voice as "and for Jesus to heal them." If it is not clear to your readers that Jesus actually healed them, you could make it explicit by saying "and Jesus healed them." (See [[:en:ta:vocabulary:active|Active or Passive]], [[:en:ta:discourse:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * <font inherit/inherit;;#B22222;;inherit>** e para serem curados ** - Isto poderia ser traduzido na voz ativa: "e para Jesus curá-los". Se não ficar claro para seus leitores que Jesus de fato os curou, você pode deixar isso explícito ao dizer: "e Jesus os curou".</font>
  * **troubled with unclean spirits**  - "bothered by unclean spirits." This could also be translated as "controlled by unclean spirits" or "held captive by unclean spirits." See the UDB for a translation using the active voice.

Se não for natural falar sobre pessoas serem curadas de espíritos imundos, isto poderia ser traduzido como: "Jesus as libertou" ou "Jesus fez os espíritos malignos saírem".</font>
  * **power to heal was coming out from him**  - This could be translated as "he had power to heal people." Jesus did not lose any power when power went out from him.
