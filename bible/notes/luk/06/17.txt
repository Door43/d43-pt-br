===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **with them**  - "with the twelve he had chosen" or "with his twelve apostles"
  * **and to be healed**  - This could be translated with the active voice as "and for Jesus to heal them." If it is not clear to your readers that Jesus actually healed them, you could make it explicit by saying "and Jesus healed them." (See [[:en:ta:vocabulary:active|Active or Passive]], [[:en:ta:discourse:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **troubled with unclean spirits**  - "bothered by unclean spirits." This could also be translated as "controlled by unclean spirits" or "held captive by unclean spirits." See the UDB for a translation using the active voice.
  * **were also healed**  - This could be translated with the active voice as "Jesus also healed." If it is not natural to talk about people being healed from unclean spirits, this could be translated as "Jesus set them free" or "Jesus made the evil spirits leave them."
  * **power to heal was coming out from him**  - This could be translated as "he had power to heal people." Jesus did not lose any power when power went out from him.
