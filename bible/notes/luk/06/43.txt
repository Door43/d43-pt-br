====== Luke 06:43-44*F ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 43 "\add People are like trees\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Healthy trees do not bear bad fruit \f + \ft Or: bear only good fruit \f*, and unhealthy trees do not bear good fruit. \v 44 \add Just like you\add* can tell if a tree is good or bad by looking at its fruit, \add you can tell which people are good and which are bad by looking at the way they\add* conduct their lives. \add For example, because thornbushes cannot produce figs\add*, no one can pick figs from thornbushes. And \add since bramble bushes cannot produce grapes\add*, no one can \add pick\add* grapes from bramble bushes. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 43 Everyone knows that healthy trees do not produce bad fruit and unhealthy trees do not produce good fruit. \v 44 And anyone can tell what kind of tree it is by looking at the kind of fruit it has. For example, a thornbush does not produce figs and a bramble bush does not produce grapes. In the same way it is easy to know what a person is like inside by looking at what that person does. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 43 For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor is there a rotten tree that produces good fruit. \v 44 For each tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces. For people do not gather figs from a thornbush, nor do they gather grapes from a briar bush. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to teach the crowd not to judge people.)
  * **For**  - "because." This links the fact that our character will be exposed as the reason why we should not judge our brother.
  * **good tree**  - "healthy tree"
  * **rotten**  - "decaying." It could be translated as "bad".
  * **each tree is known**  - "recognized." This could be translated with an active verb, as in "people know a tree" or "people recognize a tree."
  * **fig**  - the sweet-tasting fruit of the fig tree. The fig tree does not have thorns on it.
  * **thornbush**  - a plant or shrub that has thorns
  * **grape**  - the sweet-tasting fruit of the grape vine. The grape vine does not have thorns on it.
  * **briar bush**  - a vine or shrub that has thorns
  * These verses are a metaphor about how people's actions show what they are really like. If necessary, it could be explained as it is in the last sentence of the UDB with "In the same way …." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]], [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|Simile]])
