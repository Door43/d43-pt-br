===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 46 Jesus said to the people, "Why do you call me 'Lord' when you don't even obey what I say to do? \v 47 Let me tell you what people are like who come to me, hear my teachings, and obey them. \v 48 They are like a man who dug deep into the ground to prepare to build his house. He made sure that the foundation for the house was built on solid rock. Then there was a flood and a torrent of water was beating against the house. But the torrent could not even shake the house, because the house was built on a solid foundation. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 46 Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and yet you do not obey the things that I say? \v 47 Every person who comes to me and hears my words and obeys them, I will tell you what he is like. \v 48 He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep in the ground and built the house's foundation on solid rock. When a flood came, the torrent of water flowed against that house, but could not shake it, because it had been well built. </usfm>

  * (Jesus teaches the crowd about the importance of obeying him.)

  * **foundation**  - "base" or "support"
  * **solid rock**  - This is the very large, hard rock that is deep under the soil.
  * **built the house's foundation on solid rock**  - "dug the foundation of the house deep enough to reach" or "built the house on solid rock."
