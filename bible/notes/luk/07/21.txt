<usfm> \v 21 At that same time Jesus was healing many people from sicknesses and serious diseases, and from evil spirits. He also healed many blind people so that they were able to see. \v 22 So he answered those two men, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: People who were blind are now seeing. People who were lame are now walking . People who had skin diseases are being healed. People who were deaf can now hear. People who were dead are being made to live again and good news is being proclaimed to the poor. \v 23 And also tell him, "God will bless anyone who does not stop believing in me because he is angry at the things I do."

<usfm> \v 21 In that hour he cured many people from sicknesses and afflictions and from evil spirits, and he granted many blind people the ability to see. \v 22 Jesus answered and said to them, "After you have gone on your way, report to John what you have seen and heard. Blind people are receiving sight, lame people are walking, lepers are being cleansed, deaf people are hearing, dead people are being raised back to life, and needy people are being told the good news. \v 23 The person who does not stop believing in me because of my actions is blessed." </usfm>

21 Naquela hora ele curou muitas pessoas de doenças, de aflições, de espíritos malignos, e deu vista a vários cegos. 22 Jesus disse para eles: “Após vocês retornarem relatem a João tudo o que vocês têm visto e ouvido. Pessoas cegas estão recebendo a visão, pessoas coxas estão andando, leprosos estão sendo limpos, surdos estão ouvindo, mortos estão sendo trazidos de volta à vida, e aos necessitados está sendo anunciado as boas novas.” 23 Bem-aventurado aquele que não deixar de acreditar em mim por causa das minhas ações.
