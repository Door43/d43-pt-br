36 Certo fariseu estava pedindo que Jesus comesse com ele. Então Jesus entrou na casa do fariseu e se sentou à mesa para comer. 37 Havia naquela cidade uma certa mulher que era pecadora. Ao descobrir que ele estava na casa do fariseu, ela levou um vaso de alabastro com perfume. 38 Então, ela se colocou atrás dele, junto aos seus pés e pranteou. E começou a molhar os seus pés com suas lágrimas e enxugá-los com seu cabelo, beijando seus pés e ungindo com perfume.

  * **Now a certain Pharisee**  - This is the beginning of a new account.

  * **reclined at the table to eat**  - "sat down at the table for the meal." It was the custom for a relaxed meal such as this dinner for men to eat while lying down comfortably around the table.
