<usfm> \v 46 You did not \add follow our custom of welcoming guests by\add* anointing my head with \add olive\add* oil, but she has anointed my feet with fragrant perfume. \v 47 So I will tell you that even though she has sinned very much, she has been forgiven \f + \ft Or:\add I\add* have forgiven her \f*. \add By what she has done she has shown that\add* she loves \add me\add* very much.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 46 You did not anoint my head with olive oil, but she has anointed my feet with fragrant perfume. \v 47 So I tell you that she has been forgiven for her many sins and that is why she loves me very much. But a person who thinks he has only a few sins, and has been forgiven, will love me only a little bit." </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues speaking to Simon.)
  * **anoint my head with oil**  - "put oil on my head." This was a way of welcoming an honored guest. It could be translated as "welcome me by anointing my head with oil."
  * **anointed my feet**  - Though this was probably not a common practice, the woman greatly honored Jesus by doing this.
  * **has been forgiven much**  - This can also be translated in the active voice with "who has received much forgiveness" or "whom God has forgiven much."
  * **has also loved much**  - "has also loved much the one who forgave her" or "has also love God much." Some languages require that the object of "love" be stated.
  * **He who is being forgiven only a little**  - "He who is forgiven little" or "Anyone who is forgiven little." In this sentence Jesus states a general principle. However, Simon was expected to understand that Jesus was saying that Simon had loved little.
