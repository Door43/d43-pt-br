2 O escravo, muito querido, de certo centurião estava muito doente e prestes a morrer. 3 Mas como havia ouvido sobre Jesus, o centurião enviou até ele alguns anciãos dos Judeus pedindo que ele viesse e salvasse seu escravo da morte. 4 Quando eles chegaram até Jesus, pediram encarecidamente: “Ele é digno que você faça isto a ele, 5 pois ele ama nossa nação e construiu a sinagoga para nós.”
