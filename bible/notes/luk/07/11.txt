<usfm> \p \v 11 Some time after that, it happened that Jesus was traveling to a city called Nain. His disciples were going with him, along with a large crowd of people. \v 12 As he came near to the city gate, behold, a dead man was being carried out, an only son to his mother. She was a widow, and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her. \v 13 Seeing her, the Lord was deeply moved with compassion for her and said to her, "Do not cry." \v 14 Then he came forward and touched the funeral couch, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise." \v 15 The dead man sat up and began to speak. Then Jesus gave him to his mother. </usfm>

11 Algum tempo depois disto, aconteceu que Jesus estava viajando para uma cidade chamada Naim. Os seus discípulos iam com ele, juntamente com uma grande multidão. 12 Quando ele se aproximava do portão da cidade um homem morto estava sendo carregado, o filho único de sua mãe. Ele era uma viúva e uma multidão numerosa da cidade estava com ela. 13 Quando o Senhor a viu, ele ficou profundamente movido de compaixão por ela, e disse: “Não chore!” 14 Então ele chegou perto, tocou o leito funerário e os que o carregavam pararam. Ele disse: “Jovem, eu digo a você, levante.” 15 O homem que estava morto se levantou e começou a falar. Então Jesus o entregou para sua mãe.
