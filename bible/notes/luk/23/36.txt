===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **him** - "Jesus"
  * **approaching him** - "coming close to Jesus"
  * **offering him vinegar** - "offering Jesus vinegar to drink." Many Bible students believe the soldiers did this to mock him: they knew he was thirsty, so they would put the vinegar near his lips but not let him drink it.
  * **a sign over him** - "a placard hung above Jesus' head on which was written"
