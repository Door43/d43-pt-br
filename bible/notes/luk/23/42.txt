===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he added** - "the criminal also said"
  * **come into your kingdom** - "begin to rule as king" (UDB)
  * **Truly I say to you** - "Truly" adds emphasis to what Jesus is saying. This could be translated as "I want you to know that."
  * **paradise**  - This is the place that righteous people go to when they die. It can be translated as "the happy place" "the place of the righteous" or "the place where people live well." Jesus was assuring the man that he would be with God and God would accept him.
