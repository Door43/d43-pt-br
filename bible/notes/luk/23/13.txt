  * **called together the chief priests and the rulers and the crowd of people**  - "called the chief priests and the rulers and the crowd of people to come meet together"
  * **behold**  - This shows that Pilate was calling special attention to what he was about to say. It could be translated as "look" or "I want you to understand."
  * **I, having questioned him before you **- "I have questioned Jesus in your presence." This could also be translated as "I have questioned Jesus with you here as witnesses."
  * **I find no fault**  - "I do not think that he is guilty" (UDB)
