<usfm> \v 5 Then he said to them, "Suppose that one of you goes to the house of a friend at midnight. Suppose that you stand outside and call out to him, 'My friend, please lend me three loaves of bread! \v 6 Another friend of mine who is traveling has just arrived at my house, but I have no food ready to give to him!' \v 7 Suppose that he answers you from inside the house, 'Do not bother me! The door has been locked and all my family are in bed. So I cannot get up and give you anything!' \v 8 I tell you, he may not want to get up and give you any food even though you are his friend. But because you keep persisting in asking him, he will certainly get up and give you whatever you need. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 5 Jesus said to them, "Which of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight, and say to him, 'Friend, lend to me three loaves of bread, \v 6 since a friend of mine just came in from the road, and I do not have anything to set before him.' \v 7 Then the one inside, answering, may say, 'Do not bother me. The door is already shut, and my children, along with me, are in bed. I am not able to get up and give bread to you.' \v 8 I say to you, even if he does not get up and give bread to you because you are his friend, yet because of your shameless persistence, he will get up and give you as many loaves of bread as you need. </usfm>

===== Target ULB: =====

5 Jesus disse a eles: “Qual de vocês que tem um amigo e vai a meia noite até ele dizendo: 'Amigo, me empreste três pães, 6 pois um amigo meu acabou de chegar de uma jornada em minha casa e eu não tenho nada para pôr à mesa para ele.' 7 Então, o que está dentro da casa pode vir a responder: 'Não me incomode. A porta já está fechada e eu os meus filhos já estamos na cama. Eu não posso me levantar e dar pão para você.' 8 Eu te digo que mesmo que ele não se levante para dar os pães pelo fato de você ser amigo, ainda assim ele se levantará pela sua persistência, e te dará quantos pães te forem necessários.
