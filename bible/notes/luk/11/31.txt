<usfm> \v 31 Long ago the Queen of Sheba traveled a very long distance to hear Solomon speak wise things. And now someone who is much greater than Solomon is here, but you have not really listened to what I say. Therefore, at the time when God will judge all people, this queen will stand there and condemn the people alive now. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Queen of the South**  - This refers to the Queen of Sheba. Sheba was a kingdom south of Israel.
  * **will rise up in the judgment with**  - "will also stand up and judge"
  * **she came from the ends of the earth**  - "she came a very great distance." "From the ends of the earth" is an idiom that means "from a place very far away." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:idiom|idiom]])
  * **behold, someone greater**  - The word "behold" alerts us to the importance of the person who is greater than the Queen of the South in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There is someone who is even greater…” When Jesus said this, he was talking about himself.
  * **someone greater than Solomon is here**  - The rebuke that Jesus wanted them to understand was "but you have not listened to me."
