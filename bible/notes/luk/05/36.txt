He said, "People never tear a piece of cloth from a new garment and attach it to an old garment \add to mend it\add*. If they did that, not only would they be ruining the new garment by tearing it, but the new piece of cloth would not match the old garment. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 36 Then Jesus gave other examples to explain what he meant: He said, "People never tear a piece of cloth from a new garment and attach it to an old garment to mend it. If they did that, they would ruin the new garment by tearing it and the new piece of cloth would not match the old garment. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 36 Then Jesus also spoke a parable to them. "No man tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to mend an old garment. If he did that, he would tear the new garment, and the piece of cloth from the new garment would not fit with the cloth of the old garment. </usfm>

===== Target ULB: =====
36 Então Jesus contou uma parábola a eles: “Ninguém tira remendo de uma roupa nova para consertar uma roupa velha. Pois, se fizer isto a roupa nova ficará rasgada e o remendo não combinará com a roupa velha.
