<usfm> \v 3 Watch yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. \v 4 If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns to you, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him!" </usfm>
===== Target ULB: =====
3 Fiquem atento. Se o seu irmão pecar, o reprenda, e se ele se arrepender, o perdoe. 4 Se ele pecar sete vezes contra você no mesmo dia, e, se sete vezes se arrepender e pedir-lhe perdão, você deve continuar a perdoá-lo

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **your brother**  - This normally includes "your fellow-believer" as well as actual "brothers" who were born to the same mother and father.
  * **rebuke him**  - "warn him strongly" or "tell him strongly that what he did was wrong" or "correct him"
  * **if he sins**  - This is a conditional statement that talks about an event that will probably happen in the future.
  * **if he sins seven times**  - This is a hypothetical future situation. It may never happen, but even if it does, Jesus tells people to forgive.
  * **seven times in the day**  - This could be translated as "many times in a day." The number seven in the Bible is a symbol for completeness.
