===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 9 You will not thank your servant for doing the work that he had been told to do! \v 10 Similarly, when you have done everything that God has told you to do, you should say, ‘We are only God's servants and do not deserve for him to thank us. We have only done the things that he told us to do.'"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 9 He does not thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded, does he? \v 10 Even so you also, when you have done everything that you are commanded, should say, 'We are unworthy servants. We have only done what we ought to do.'" </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples.)
  * **He does not thank**  - Depending on how you translated the previous two verses, this could also be translated as "He would not thank" or "You would not thank."
  * **the things that were commanded**  - "the things you commanded him to do"
  * **does he?**  - This could be translated as "right?" or "Isn't this true?" With this rhetorical question, Jesus encourages his disciples to acknowledge that what he is saying is obviously true. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical questions]].)
  * **you also**  - Jesus was speaking to his disciples, so languages that have a plural form of "you" would use it. (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:formsofyou|formsofyou]])
  * **should say**  - "should say to God"
  * **We are unworthy servants**  - This could be translated as "We are ordinary slaves" or "We servants to do not deserve your praise."
