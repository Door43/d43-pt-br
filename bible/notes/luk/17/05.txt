===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Increase our faith**  - "Please give us more faith" or "Please add more faith to our faith"
  * **If you had faith as a mustard seed**  - This could be translated as "If you had faith that was even as small as mustard seed" or "If only your faith was as big as a mustard seed, but it isn't." The construction of the phrase implies that they did not, in fact, have faith that was even the size of a mustard seed.
  * **be uprooted, and be planted in the sea**  - This could be translated as "uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea" or "take your roots out of the ground, and put your roots down into the ocean."
  * **it would obey you**  - "the tree would obey you" This result is conditional. It would happen only if they had faith.
