===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Being asked by the pharisees**  - This can be translated with an active verb. "The Pharisees asked Jesus." (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:active|Active or Passive]]) This is the beginning of a new part of the story. Some translations start it with "One day" (UDB) or "Once."
  * **when the kingdom of God would come**  - This can be translated with a direct quote: "When will the kingdom of God come?" (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:quotation|Speech Quotations]])
  * **The kingdom of God does not come with observation**  - This could be translated as "Although you look for the kingdom of God, you will not see it." They would not see that Jesus was already among them as the king because they were looking for a physical kingdom.
  * **The kingdom of God is among you**  - It can be translated as "The kingdom of God is here" or "God has already begun to rule among you."
