===== Target ULB: =====

18 Com muitas outras formas, João exortava o povo e pregava as boas novas. 19 E repreendeu Herodes o tetrarca por ter se casado com a mulher do seu irmão, Herodinas, e por muitas coisas más que ele havia feito. 20 Mas então Herodes fez outra coisa muito má. Ele lançou João na prisão.
