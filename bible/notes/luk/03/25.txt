  * (This is a continuation of the list of Jesus' ancestors.)
  * **the son of Matthathias, the son of Amos…**  - This could be translated as “who was the son of Matthathias, who was the son of Amos…” or “Joseph was the son of Matthathias, Matthathias was the son of Amos…” or “Joseph's father was Mattathias, Matthathias's father was Amos….” Use the same wording as you used in the previous verses.
