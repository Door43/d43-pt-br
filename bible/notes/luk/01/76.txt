===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Zechariah continues to prophecy, but now he speaks directly to his newborn son:)
  * **will be called the prophet**  - This means he actually will be the prophet and people will know him as such. To make that clear, this could be translated as "will be the prophet."
  * **of the Most High**  - This could be translated as "who serves the Most High" or "who speaks for God Most High."
  * **how they can be saved through the forgiveness of their sins**  - This can be translated as "how God will save them by forgiving their sins."
