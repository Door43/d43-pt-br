===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **found favor with God**  - This could be translated as "God has decided to give you his grace” or “God is being gracious to you" or “God is showing you his kindness.”
  * **Behold**  - "Look" or "See" or "Listen"
  * **call his name**  - "call him" or "name him" or "give him the name"
  * **will be called the Son of the Most High**  - This could be translated as "people will call him the Son of the Most High One" or "people will acknowledge that he is the Son of God Most High."
  * **give him the throne of his father, David**- This could be translated as "give him authority to rule as king like his ancestor David did." The throne represents the king's authority to rule. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **his father**  - The Bible often uses the word "fathers" to refer to ancestors and uses the word "sons" to refer to descendants. The word "his" refers to Mary's son.
