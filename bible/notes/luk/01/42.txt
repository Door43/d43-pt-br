===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **She**  – It may be more clear or more natural to say "Elizabeth" here, depending on how you translated the previous verse.
  * **the fruit of your womb**  - This could be translated as "the baby in your womb" or "the baby you will bear" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **How is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me?**  - This could be translated as "How wonderful it is that the mother of my Lord has come to me!" Elizabeth was not asking for information. Rather she was showing how surprised and happy she was that the mother of the Lord had come to her. (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **the mother of my Lord**  - This could be translated as "you, the mother of my Lord" since this refers to Mary.
  * **leaped**  - "moved suddenly" or "turned forcefully"
  * **She who has believed is blessed**  - This could be translated as "You who have believed are blessed" or "Because you believed you will be glad."
  * **the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord**  - This could be translated as "the message from the Lord that was given to her" or "the things that the Lord told you."
