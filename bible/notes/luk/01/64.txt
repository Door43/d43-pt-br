64 Imediatamente sua boca se abriu e sua língua se soltou, e ele começou a falar, louvando a Deus. 65 Então temor veio sobre todos os que viviam ao seu redor e tudo o que aconteceu foi falado por toda a área de colinas da Judeia. 66 Todos aqueles que ouviram o que aconteceu, ficaram pensando sobre o ocorrido. Disseram:“O que será que esta criança vai ser quando crescer?” Pois eles perceberam que a mão do Senhor estava sobre ele.
