===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 46 Sometime later, the disciples began to argue among themselves about which one of them would be the most important. \v 47 But Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he brought a young child to stand beside him. \v 48 He said to them, "If someone welcomes a little child like this because of me, it is the same as welcoming me. And if someone welcomes me, it is the same as welcoming God, who sent me. Remember that those among you who seem to be the least important are the ones whom God considers to be most important."

<usfm> \p \v 46 Then a dispute started among them about which one of them would be the greatest. \v 47 But when Jesus realized what they were reasoning in their hearts, he took a little child, and set him by his side, \v 48 and said to them, "If someone receives a little child like this in my name, he also is receiving me, and if someone receives me, he is also receiving the one who sent me. For the person who is least among all of you is the one who is great." </usfm>
