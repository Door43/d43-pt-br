<usfm> \v 7 Herod, the ruler over the district of Galilee, heard about everything that was happening. He was perplexed, because some people were saying that John the Baptizer had become alive again. \v 8 Other people were saying that the prophet Elijah had appeared again and still others were saying that one of the other prophets from long ago had become alive again. \v 9 But Herod said, "It cannot be John because I had his head cut off. So who is this man that I am hearing these things about?" And he kept looking for a way to see Jesus.

<usfm> \p \v 7 Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard about all that was happening and he was very disturbed, because it was said by some that John the Baptizer had risen from the dead, \v 8 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the ancient prophets had risen to life again. \v 9 Herod said, "I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?" And Herod tried to find a way to see Jesus. </usfm>

===== Target ULB: =====

7 Herodes, o tetrarca, ouviu sobre tudo o que estava acontecendo e ficou perplexo, pois uns diziam que João Batista ressuscitou da morte, 8 alguns diziam que Elias apareceu e outros diziam que um dos profetas antigos voltou à vida. 9 Herodes disse: “Eu decapitei João, então quem pode ser este sobre o qual eu ouço tais coisas?” E Herodes tentou encontrar alguma maneira de ver Jesus.
