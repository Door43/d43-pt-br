===== Translation Notes: =====

<font inherit/inherit;;#B22222;;inherit>Informações úteis para a tradução:</font>

  * **the crowd welcomed him**  - This could be translated as "the crowd joyfully greeted him."
  * <font inherit/inherit;;#B22222;;inherit>** a multidão o recebeu ** - Isto poderia ser traduzido como: "a multidão alegremente o saudou".</font>
  * **And behold, there came a man named Jairus**  - The word "behold" alerts us to Jairus as a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There was a man who was named Jairus.”
  * <font inherit/inherit;;#B22222;;inherit>** Então veio um homem chamado Jairo ** - A palavra "então" alerta-nos para Jairo como sendo uma nova pessoa na história". Sua língua deve ter um modo de fazer isso. Inglês usa: "Havia um homem chamado Jairo".</font>
  * **one of the leaders of the synagogue**  - "one of the leaders at the local synagogue" or "a leader of the people who met at the synagogue in that area"
  * <font inherit/inherit;;#B22222;;inherit>** um dos líderes da sinagoga  ** - "um dos líderes da sinagoga local" ou "um líder das pessoas que se encontravam na sinagoga naquela área"</font> .
  * **he fell down at Jesus' feet**  - 1) “bowed down at Jesus feet” or 2) “lay down on the ground at Jesus feet.” Jairus did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.

  * **she was dying**  - "she was about to die" or "she was near death"
  * <font inherit/inherit;;#B22222;;inherit>** ela estava morrendo ** - "ela estava prestes a morrer" ou "ela estava perto da morte".</font>
  * **But as he was going**  - Some translators may need to first say "So Jesus agreed to go with the man." (See: [[:en:ta:discourse:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * <font inherit/inherit;;#B22222;;inherit>** mas enquanto ele ia  ** - Alguns tradutores talvez precisem primeiro dizer: "Então Jesus concordou em ir com o homem".</font>
