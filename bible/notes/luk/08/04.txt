<usfm> \v 4 One day a very large crowd was gathering, because people were traveling to see Jesus from many different towns. Then he told them this story: \v 5 "A man went out to his field to plant some grain seeds. As he was scattering them over the soil, some of the seeds fell on the hard pathway. Then people walked on those seeds, and birds ate them. \v 6 Some of the seeds fell on rocky ground which had very little soil. Therefore, as soon as the seeds grew, the plants dried up because there was no moisture. </usfm>

4 Quando uma grande multidão de pessoas se ajuntou, incluindo pessoas que vinham de outras cidades para encontrá-lo, Jesus falou a eles por meio de uma parábola: 5 “Um semeador saiu para semear algumas sementes. Enquanto ele semeava, algumas sementes caíram a beira do caminho, elas foram pisoteadas, e os pássaros do céu comeram todas elas. 6 Outras sementes caíram em solo rochoso, assim que elas cresceram elas murcharam, pois não havia umidade.
