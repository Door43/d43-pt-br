34 Quando os homens que estavam cuidando dos porcos viram o que aconteceu, eles fugiram e relataram isto na cidade e nos campos. 35 As pessoas que ouviram sobre isto foram ver o que aconteceu, quando se aproximaram de Jesus elas viram o homem de quem os demônios saíram. Ele estava vestido, são, sentado aos pés de Jesus, e eles ficaram com medo.
