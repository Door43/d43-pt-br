\v 7 Some of the seeds fell on ground that contained seeds of thorn plants. The thorn plants grew up together with the young grain plants and crowded them out so that they could not grow.
\v 8 But some of the grain seeds fell on fertile soil, and grew so well that they produced a crop that had a hundred times as many seeds." After saying these things, Jesus called out to them, "All of you should think carefully about what you just heard me say!"

\v 7 Still other seeds fell among thorn plants, and the thorn plants grew up together with the seeds and choked them.
\v 8 But some of the seeds fell on good soil, and grew into healthy plants, which produced a crop that was a hundred times greater." After Jesus had said these things, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."

**7** Ainda outras sementes caíram entre plantas espinhosas, elas cresceram juntamente e os espinhos as sufocaram. **8** Mas algumas sementes caíram em solo bom, e cresceram saudáveis, e produziram uma colheita cem vezes maior.” Após Jesus dizer estas coisas, ele exclamou em alta voz: “Aquele que tem ouvidos para ouvir, ouça.”
