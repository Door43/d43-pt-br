===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 When his master heard what the manager had done, he admired the dishonest manager for the clever thing he had done. The truth is that the ungodly people in this world act more cleverly toward other people than godly people act. \v 9 So I tell you this: Use the money that you have here on earth to help others so that they will become your friends. Then when you die, they will welcome you into an eternal home.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 The master then commended the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly, since the sons of this world are more shrewd concerning their own people than the sons of the light are. \v 9 I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of worldly wealth, so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal dwellings. </usfm>
