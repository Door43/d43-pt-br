===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples.)
  * **Do not look for what you will eat and drink**  - "Do not focus on what you will eat and drink" or "do not greatly desire more to eat and drink"
  * **all the nations of the world**  - This can be translated as "all people of other nations" or "all the unbelievers in the world." "Nations" is used here as a metonym for "unbelievers." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy|metonymy]])
