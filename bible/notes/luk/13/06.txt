===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues speaking to the crowd.)
  * **Jesus told this parable**  - He spoke the parable to explain his statement in the previous verse that they should repent or perish.
  * **Why let it waste the ground**  - This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as a statement as it is in the UDB or as a command: "Do not let it waste the ground." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|rhetoricalquestion]])
