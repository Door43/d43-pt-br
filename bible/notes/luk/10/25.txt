\v 25 One day as Jesus was teaching people, a certain teacher of Jewish laws was there. He wanted to test Jesus by asking him a difficult question. So he stood up and asked, "Teacher, what must I do in order to live with God forever?"
\v 26 Jesus said to him, "You have read what Moses has written in the laws that God gave him. What do the laws say?"
\v 27 The man replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength and with all your mind. And love your neighbor as much as you love yourself."
\v 28 Jesus replied, "You have answered correctly. If you do all that, you will live with God forever."

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Behold** - This event happens at a later time. You can make this clear to the reader as in the UDB: "One day as Jesus was teaching people."
    * **And behold, a certain teacher** - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There was a certain teacher...”
    * **tested him** - "tested Jesus"
    * **What is written in the law** - This can be translated with an active verb: "What did Moses write in the law" or "What do the scriptures say?" (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:active]])
    * **How do you read it?** - "What have you read in it?" or "What do  you understand it to say?"
    * **your neighbor**  - This refers to a member of your community. It can be translated as your "your fellow-citizen" or "the people of your community."
