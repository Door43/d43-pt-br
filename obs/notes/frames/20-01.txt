  * **broke the covenant** - That is, "disobeyed the commands God had given them in his covenant with them at Mount Sinai."
  * **warn them to repent and worship him again** – Another way to translate this would be, "tell them to stop sinning and to worship Yahweh instead of other gods, or terrible things would happen to them."
