==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **the people** - See "my people" in **[[:pt-br:obs:notes:frames:09-13|[09-13]]]**.
  * **I AM WHO I AM** - This description shows that God can only be defined by himself, not by anything else that we know of, and he cannot be compared to anyone else.
  * **I AM** - This name emphasizes that God is the only one who has always lived and always will live.
  * **my name** - The name that God told Moses and all of Israel to use for him is "Yahweh," which is related to "I AM" and appears to mean, "HE IS."
