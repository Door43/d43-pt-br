Another time when the people did not have any water, **God** told **Moses**, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But **Moses dishonored God** in front of all the people **by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it**. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, “You will not enter the **Promised Land**.”

  * **by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it** - This can be translated as, "Moses did not speak to the rock; he hit it twice with a stick."
